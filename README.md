# Boat Freight API

Boat Freight API allows a user to perform the standard Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on boats and freight ("loads"). In addition, the user can put loads on and remove loads from boats. Endpoint details can be found in [`api-specs.pdf`](api-specs.pdf).

The app was originally connected to Auth0 for user creation and authentication. Boat, load, and user entities were stored on Google Cloud Platform's Datastore and the project was deployed on Google App Engine.

This was the final project for Oregon State University's CS 493 - Cloud Application Development course.
